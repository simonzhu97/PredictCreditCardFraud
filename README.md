# Predict Credit Card Fraudulent Transactions with XGBoost
This is a mini solo project that examines credit card transactions and tries to identify fraudulent activities.

## Data
The original data comes from a Kaggle dataset. https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

1. newtrain_transaction_200000.csv: This is a training dataset that includes transaction details such as transaction time, transaction id, location and etc.
2. newtrain_identity.csv: The additional features about card holder identities for the training samples are included in this dataset. Notice that the data has already been anonymized.

## Code
The Codes folder includes several files.
1. __XGBoost_Jupyter_Notebook__: a Jupyter notebook that contains sections about data cleaning, feature engineering, model building and testing, final conclusions and future works.
2. __XGBoost_Python__: Considering that Jupyter notebook requires installation of the platform on the computer, I also include a Python version of codes on this repository for accessibility.
